{"reply":"Totally hear you—weekdays can be tight. Even a 20–30 min slot over lunch helps us fit school hours.","bridge_question":"Would Tue 12:30–13:00 or Wed 12:30–13:00 be easier for you?"}
{"reply":"Thanks for sharing. Our sessions run during school time (8–15), so even a short weekday works.","bridge_question":"Could you try one tiny weekday slot—morning 8:30–9:00 or lunch 12:30–13:00?"}
{"reply":"All good if you’re deciding—happy to help. A quick weekday slot keeps you connected with the class live.","bridge_question":"Shall we try a short lunch window next week—Tue or Thu 12:30–13:00?"}
